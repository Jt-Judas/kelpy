kelpy - kid experimental library in python

TODO: The examples are from older versions and likely will not work well! Please wait for new ones...

Put this library somewhere--mine lives in /home/piantado/mit/Libraries/kelpy/
	
Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to LOTlib/:
	
	export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/piantado/Desktop/mit/Libraries/kelpy
	
You can put this into your .bashrc file to make it loaded automatically when you open a terminal. On ubuntu and most linux, this is:
	
	echo 'export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/home/piantado/Desktop/mit/Libraries/kelpy' >> ~/.bashrc

And you should be ready to use the library


The basic approach of Kelpy is to handle simple animations and things, taking care of the main refresh-display loop in pygame, and letting us just construct sequences of object actions and handle events. Future work will handle fancier counterbalancing, etc.

Matthew McGovern is awesome (and made all of the sounds).
