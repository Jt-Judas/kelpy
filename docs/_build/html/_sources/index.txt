kelpy Documentation
===================

The basic approach of Kelpy is to handle simple animations and things, taking care of the main refresh-display loop in pygame, and letting us just construct sequences of object actions and handle events. Future work will handle fancier counterbalancing, etc. 

*Kelpy is a work in progress, so please be mindful that some demos and classes may not function as intended just yet!*
