Kelpy Demo 1: Display Something, Handle a Click.
	This is a simple demonstration of how to create an object (a CommandableImageSprite) and handle clicks on that object using the DisplayQueue, OrderedUpdates, and EventHandler classes.

	This demo also introduces you to the myriad of usefull functions from the Kelpy Miscellaneous class. These include:
	
	kelpy_standard_event_loop
		This function loops infinitely to process interactions between the user and the events being displayed onto the screen.
	
	kstimulus
		This function is used to make items in the kelpy/stimulus file available to python/kelpy scripts, reguardless of where the kelpy scripts live on your hard drive.

	filename
		This function, when it is fed a full filepath (such as 'home/mmcgove/Documents/CODE/kelpy/stimuli/image.png') will return the filename (such as 'image.png').
