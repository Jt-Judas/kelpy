Demo 1: Display Something, Handle a Click.
	This is a simple demonstration of how to create an object (a CommandableImageSprite) and handle clicks on that object using the DisplayQueue, OrderedUpdates, and EventHandler classes.

Demo 2: Display a Few Things, Handle Alternatives.
	This is a slightly more complex demonstration of how to set up an array of images to create multiple CommandableImageSprites. This demonstration uses the DisplayQueue and OrderedUpdates classes to create some simple animations, and later uses the EventHandler to handle clicks on the objects. There are different responses based on whether the CommandableImageSprite is determined to be the 'correct' object or not.

Demo 3: Two Versions of the Two Alternative Forced Choice Task.
	The two versions of this program (demo3a.py and demo3b.py) demonstrate how to run a simple Two Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) task. Two options are presented, one is preferred. When the preferred object is selected, a 'hooray!' sound is played. When the unpreferred option is selected, a 'boooo' noise is played. The data is noted through the system console, and would have to be 'piped' to be written to a file.
