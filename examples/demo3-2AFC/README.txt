Demo 3: Two Versions of the Two Alternative Forced Choice Task.

The two versions of this program (demo3a.py and demo3b.py) demonstrate how to run a simple Two Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) task. Two options are presented, one is preferred. When the preferred object is selected, a 'hooray!' sound is played. When the unpreferred option is selected, a 'boooo' noise is played. The data is noted through the system console, and would have to be 'piped' to be written to a file.

They make use of the same functions used in the other demos, with a few additions.

Demo3b makes use of the csv.reader to intake a .csv file of stimuli.
