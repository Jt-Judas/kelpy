"""
KELPY is the Kid Experimental Library in PYthon.

The basic approach of Kelpy is to handle simple animations and things, taking care of the main refresh-display loop in pygame, and letting us just construct sequences of object actions and handle events.

Dependencies:
	
+	PIL
+	Pygame

Be sure to check the examples for simple demonstrations of how to use kelpy to your full advantage!
